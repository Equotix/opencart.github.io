<h1>Cron</h1>
<p>A cron is a service that allows the system to automatically execute a script at a specific time without human intervention. This page will list all the cron tasks added by extensions in your store.</p>
<h2>Setting up Cron Jobs</h2>
<p>You will need to add a cron task to run hourly on your server to trigger OpenCart&apos;s cron system. Depending on the control panel you use, the steps varies. The cron command to be added is shown at Extensions > Cron Jobs.</p>
