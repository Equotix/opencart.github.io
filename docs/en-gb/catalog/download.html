<h1>Downloads</h1>
<p>If you have downloadable files to attach to your products, it should be created here. Only then, your customers will be able to retrieve these downloadable files when they purchase a product linked with the files.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Customers will be required to create an account during checkout and will not be able to checkout as a guest if the product he is purchasing has a download linked to it.</div>
<h2>Downloads Listing Page</h2>
<p>The list of available downloads that you have created will be displayed on this page. You can get started by clicking on the &quot;Add New&quot; button at the top right of the page.</p>

<h2>Creating a Download</h2>
<p>Adding a download file is straightforward with just a couple of clicks. The fields available are explained below.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Download Name *</th>
    <td width="*">This is the name of the download.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Filename</th>
    <td>This is the actual filename of the file stored on the server. You can enter the filename if you uploaded the file through FTP, or just click on the upload button beside this field to select a file to upload.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Mask</th>
    <td>This is the filename that will be shown when the customer downloads the file.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" class="hints">* Required field</td>

<h2>Assigning to a Product</h2>
<p>You will also need to assign the newly created download file to the relevant product. To do that, you have to access Catalog &gt; Products &gt; <a href="en-gb/catalog/product/links/">Links tab</a> and add the download file to the product.</p>
<h2>Downloading at Store Front</h2>
<p>When a customer makes an order with a download file attached to the product, he will be able to download the file from the &quot;Downloads&quot; page of his account.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
  The downloadable file will not be shown on the product page. Hence, it is a good idea to describe how the customer will receive his file in the product description. For example, you can write a message in the product description such as &quot;Your file can be downloaded from your account Downloads page once you've made the purchase.&quot;
