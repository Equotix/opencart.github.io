<h1>Information</h1>
<p>Information is used to provide your customer with details that you think they might need. Information can be pages such as terms and conditions of your store, store address map or any other information that you think may be useful for the customer. Information pages can be displayed at the footer of your website too.</p>
<h2>Information Listing Page</h2>
<p>On the information listing page, you will have the option to edit, delete, or insert a new information page.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><i class="fa  fa-check-circle"></i> About Us, Delivery Information, Privacy Policy, and Terms &amp; Conditions comes with the default installation because they are the most important information pages used in an online store. We recommend that you edit these pages rather than delete them.</div>

For more information on layouts, see <a href="en-gb/extension/module/">Modules</a>. You can just leave it blank if you do not wish to override the layout.</p>
