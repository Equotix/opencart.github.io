<h1>Manufacturers</h1>
<p>Manufacturers, also known as &quot;Brands&quot;, allows you to group the products from the same brand together. This would allow your customers to easily identify products according to their favourite brands.</p>
<h2>Manufacturers Listing Page</h2>
<p>The manufacturers listed below came with the default installation. They can be deleted and new manufacturers can be added in its place. The manufacturers should be created before you add a product, similar to the categories. Click on the &quot;Add New&quot; button to get started with creating a new manufacturer.</p>

<h2>Creating a Manufacturer</h2>
<p>Creating a manufacturer is pretty much similar to creating a category. Get started by filling up the manufacturer&apos;s information.</p>
<h3>General Tab</h3>
<p>The fields available in the general tab are explained below.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Manufacturer Name *</th>
    <td width="*">This is the name of the manufacturer which will be shown.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Stores</th>
    <td>This is used to specify which store this manufacturer should be linked to (this only applies when you are managing more than one store with OpenCart&apos;s multi-store feature).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <td>This is used to set the image or logo for this manufacturer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Sort Order</th>
    <td>This allows you to specify the position of the manufacturer displayed on the menu. The value &quot;1&quot; would take precedence as compared to the values &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>SEO Tab</h3>
<p>This tab is the same as the products and categories SEO tab. It asks for the following information.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Keyword</th>
      <td width="*">Assign a unique keyword to make your manufacturer page URL search engine friendly. It is recommended that you use all lowercase characters, and replace spaces with a hyphen.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Design Tab</h3>
<p>The manufacturer design tab is also the same as as the categories design tab. It allows you to configure the &quot;Layout Override&quot; feature. In this feature, you can choose to override a layout, such as using an &quot;Account&quot; page layout for this specific manufacturer page instead of the default &quot;Manufacturer&quot; layout. For more information on layouts, see <a href="en-gb/extension/module/">Modules</a>. You can just leave it blank if you do not wish to override the layout.</p>

<h2>Assigning to a Product</h2>
<p>You will also need to assign the manufacturer to the relevant product. To do that, you have to access Catalog &gt; Products &gt; <a href="en-gb/catalog/product/links/">Links tab</a> and add the manufacturer to the product if you have yet to do so.</p>
<h2>Store Front</h2>
<p>The manufacturers feature has its own dedicated page at the store front. It can be accessed from the link at the footer, which is shown as &quot;Brands&quot;. Clicking on the link will bring the customer to your brands directory, and will display all the available brands that you have in the store.</p>
