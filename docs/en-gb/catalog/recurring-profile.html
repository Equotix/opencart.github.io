<h1>Recurring Profiles</h1>
<p>Recurring profiles are used to setup recurring payments for your customers. This means that the recurring profile could be a subscription or installment, which requires the customer to pay a fee over a period of time, such as a monthly or annual subscription.</p>
<h2>Recurring Profiles Listing Page</h2>
<p>You can view all the available recurring profiles in the Recurring Profiles page under the Catalog menu. Once you are ready to create a new recurring profile, you can click on the &quot;Add New&quot; button at the top right of the page.</p>
