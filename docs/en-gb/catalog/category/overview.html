<h1>Category Overview</h1>
<p>Categories allow your products to be organised into groups. These categories can be listed in the top menu of your store where customers can easily view and identify products they are interested in.</p>
<p>Categories play an important role in your OpenCart store and it is highly advisable to plan on the categories for your products before adding the products to your store.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> When adding a product without a product category, the product will not show up under any categories in the front end of the store. The product page can only be accessible if the customer types in the product name, one of the product tags in the search box, or visits the product through a manufacturer page. If you want this product to be more visible to your customers in the store front, we suggest that the category is created prior to adding the product.</div>
<h2>Category Listing Page</h2>
<p>Upon clicking on the Categories under the Catalog menu, the categories that are available in your store should appear and be listed in alphabetical order.</p>
<img src="image/catalog/category/category-list.png" alt="Category Listing Page" class="img-thumbnail" />
<p class="text-center"><small>The page displaying the available categories.</small></p>
<p>Every row of category will contain the following information.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Category Name</th>
      <td width="*">This is the category name.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Sort Order</th>
      <td>The Sort Order indicates the order that the categories are displayed in the top menu and category box on the product page. Desktop (sort order-1) will be sorted above Laptops &amp; Notebooks (sort order-2) because it has a higher priority.
        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Leaving &quot;Sort Order&quot; blank will organise the categories in alphabetical order.</div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The categories above were included by default with the installation. You may delete them to make room for the store&apos;s product categories. To delete, check the box next to the row that the category is listed on. When the categories selected for deletion are checked, &quot;Delete&quot; can be clicked on in the upper right corner. This should remove the categories completely.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The &quot;&gt;&quot; symbol points from a parent category to a sub-category. &quot;Components &gt; Mice and Trackballs&quot; indicates that &quot;Mice and Trackballs&quot; is a sub-category sorted under the parent category &quot;Components&quot;.</div>
<p>Clicking &quot;Edit&quot; under &quot;Action&quot; will direct the administrator to a form to change the category information. Clicking &quot;Add New&quot; will allow the shop owner to insert more categories to the site.</p>
<h2>Creating a Category</h2>
<p>Before you learn how to add products, you will need to understand how to create product categories. Product category is an essential organisational feature in OpenCart. OpenCart organises the structure of an online store around these product categories. Every product category gets their own space in the store to display all the available products for that category.</p>
<p>Organising products into categories is useful for navigating a store&apos;s inventory in both the store front and administration side. In the administration, creating categories for products will help the shop owner keep track of specific products within a category. In the store front, customers will be able to browse their favorite products by category. Category pages can be accessed in the top menu of your store front.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> Before adding products into OpenCart, you should take some time to brainstorm and establish categories for your products. Think of how the products in your store can be organized into groups in a logical manner. Generally, you would want to start with creating a broad parent category, and move narrower into specification with each sub-category below it. For example, a broad category such as Electronics is a good parent category. Under the Electronics, a sub-category named &quot;Computers&quot; can be created; and under that category, &quot;Laptops&quot;. You can see how each category becomes more specific as we progress. Putting effort into this task will improve a store&apos;s usability, ultimately bringing customers to other products in the store that may interest them.</div>
<p>Go to Catalog &gt; Category in the administration. If this is your first time in the category section you will see a list of categories created for the default products. Feel free to delete them to make room for your store&apos;s products. To create a new category you can click &quot;Add New&quot; in the upper right corner. You will be directed to the category&apos;s form page. Category information can be filled out under four tabs: &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Data&quot;, &quot;SEO&quot;, &quot;Design&quot;.</p>
