<h1>Attributes Overview</h1>
<p>Attributes are being used by products to provide customers with a comparison. It is always a good practice to have universal attributes and they can be created here. The attributes created here can then be assigned to the relevant products. Attributes can be used to describe the size, weight, colour or any other specifications of the product that have potential for comparison.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Attributes</h2>
<p>Getting started with attributes, you will first need to setup the attribute groups before you create the attributes. Head over to the <a href="en-gn/attribute/group/">Attribute Groups</a> page to start creating your first attribute group.</p>
