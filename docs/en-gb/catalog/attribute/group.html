<h1>Attribute Groups</h1>
<p>Attribute Groups organise the different attributes into groups for easy maintenance. By placing attributes into the appropriate groups, you will find it easier when you are trying to modify products. For example, attributes such as &quot;Clockspeed&quot; and &quot;No. of Cores&quot; can be organised under the larger attribute group of &quot;Processor&quot;.</p>
<h2>Attribute Groups Listing Page</h2>
<p>The available attribute groups are listed on this page. You can either delete or add more attribute groups on this page.</p>

<h2>Creating an Attribute Group</h2>
<p>You can simply click on the &quot;Add New&quot; button at the top right of the listing page to get started. You will then be presented with two basic fields, which is further explained below.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Attribute Group Name *</th>
    <td width="*">This is the name of the attribute group which will be shown.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Sort Order</th>
    <td>This allows you to specify the position of the filter value. The value &quot;1&quot; would take precedence as compared to the values &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Deleting an Attribute Group</h2>
<p>Attribute groups cannot be deleted until all attributes have been unassigned from it. As such, if you wish to delete an attribute group, you will first need to remove any attributes that are linked to it.</p>
