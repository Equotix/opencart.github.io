<h2>Creating an Attribute</h2>
<p>You can simply click on the &quot;Add New&quot; button at the top right of the listing page to get started. You will then be presented with a couple of fields, which is further explained below.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Attribute Name *</th>
    <td width="*">This is the name of the attribute which will be shown.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute Group</th>
    <td>This is the group this attribute will be assigned to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Sort Order</th>
    <td>This allows you to specify the position of the filter value. The value &quot;1&quot; would take precedence as compared to the values &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
