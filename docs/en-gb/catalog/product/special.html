<h1>Product Special Tab</h1>
<p>The Special tab is similar to the Discount tab, except that this is a special offer price without a need for bulk quantity purchase. The various fields are explained below.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Customer Group</th>
      <td width="*">This is used to specify which customer group is entitled to the discount. Guest customers without a customer group will be assigned to the default customer group which is set in System &gt; Settings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Priority</th>
      <td>This is used to specify which discount would apply first if there are multiple discounts for the selected item. The priority number &quot;1&quot; will take precedence over the priority number &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Price</th>
      <td>This is the discounted price to be used.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Date Start</th>
      <td>This is used to specify when the discounted price will become effective. You can leave it empty, which means it starts right away.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Date End</th>
      <td>This is used to specify when the discounted price will cease. You can leave it empty, which means there is no end date.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>In the example below, you can see that the &quot;Camera&quot; product has a special offer assigned to it. This means that the customer will just pay $86 for the product. The original price will be slashed out and displayed on the store front, with the new offer price replacing it.</p>
