<h1>Product Attribute Tab</h1>
<p><a href="en-gb/catalog/attribute/">Attributes</a> are the specifications of the product that are used for comparison between products in the Product Comparison page at the store front. Attributes will also appear on the assigned product page.</p>
<p>Attributes can be created under Catalog &gt; Attributes. Once added, you can then assign the attributes to the product in this tab. You can get started by clicking the &quot;Add Attribute&quot; button and fill up the fields accordingly. The various fields are explained below.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Attribute *</th>
      <td width="*">Enter the attribute here and select from the dropdown autocomplete to use the attribute.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Text</th>
      <td>This is the specification for the attribute. Enter any text here for it to be displayed at the store front.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2" class="hints">* Required field</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p class="text-center"><small>The product attribute tab.</small></p>
<p>An example of an attribute would be the amount of RAM a computer has. You can specify the amount RAM for the computer in this tab, similar to the image above. Simply add the attribute in Catalog &gt; Attributes before you assign it to this product here. See <a href="en-gb/catalog/attribute/">Attributes</a> for a more in depth explanation of attributes.</p>
