<h1>Product Reward Points Tab</h1>
<p>Reward points is a feature in OpenCart that assigns customers &quot;loyalty points&quot; for purchasing from your store. Customers can use these acquired points as a currency to purchase products for their subsequent orders. You can assign this product a certain number of reward points required for a customer to purchase it with. If you don&apos;t want to allow this product to be bought with reward points, you can simply leave the fields blank. The fields available are explained below.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Buy Points</th>
      <td width="*">This is the number of points required by a customer to purchase this product. Leaving it empty of setting it as 0 will prevent customers from using points to purchase this product.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Reward Points</th>
      <td>Set the number of reward points to be allocated to the customer upon successfully purchasing this product. The points can be allocated based on the customer group the customer belongs to. Leaving it as empty or zero disables this feature as well.</td>
    </tr>
