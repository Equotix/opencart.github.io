<h1>Product Recurring Tab</h1>
<p>Recurring profiles can be added to the product to make it a recurring subscription or an installment product. Clicking on the &quot;Add Recurring&quot; button will add a new row for you to choose from the list of available <a href="en-gb/catalog/recurring-profile/">Recurring Profiles</a>. You will need to create a Recurring Profile beforehand to assign it to the product. The fields are explained below.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Recurring Profile</th>
      <td width="*">Select from the list of available recurring profiles already created in your store.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Customer Group</th>
      <td>Choose the customer group this recurring profile should be applied to.</td>
