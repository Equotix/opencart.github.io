<h1>Product Overview</h1>
<p>Products are the bread and butter of the average OpenCart store. Therefore, it is essential that you learn how to manage your store&apos;s product inventory using the OpenCart administration interface. Before adding products, you must make sure that you have all the necessary information about the product you are adding to the store. To get detailed information of your products to your customer, OpenCart requires this information to be gathered beforehand. The more information given to OpenCart about a specific product, the more informed the customer will be about that particular product when purchasing it from your store.</p>
<h2>Product Listing Page</h2>
<p>Upon clicking on the Products under the Catalog menu, the products available in your store should appear and be listed in alphabetical order.</p>
<img src="image/catalog/product/product-list.png" alt="Product Listing Page" class="img-thumbnail" />
<p class="text-center"><small>The page displaying the available products.</small></p>
<p>Every row of product will contain the following information.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Image</th>
      <td width="*">This is the main product image.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Product Name</th>
      <td>This is the product name.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Status</th>
      <td>This is the status of the product. If disabled, it will not display at the store front.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <td>This is the model code for the product.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Price</th>
      <td>This is the selling price for the product.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Quantity</th>
      <td>This is the available quantity for the product. The colour code indicates the stock level accordingly, from green, to red (&le; 5 quantity) and finally to orange (&le; 0 quantity).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Checking an individual box in the first column will select the product information within the same row. Once selected, you can choose to &quot;Copy&quot; or &quot;Delete&quot; the product. &quot;Copy&quot; will duplicate the product and it&apos;s information accordingly, without the SEO keyword. The copied product will also be set to <strong>disabled</strong> by default. &quot;Delete&quot; will remove the products selected completely (this will not affect the orders on the website).</p>
<p>If you would like to look up a product in the product list, you can use &quot;Autocomplete&quot; as a shortcut to search for the product name. For more information on the Autocomplete feature, visit <a href="en-gb/administration/autocomplete/">Autocomplete</a>. Pressing &quot;Add New&quot; at the top right corner will direct the administrator to a form to add new products.</p>
<h2>Creating a Product</h2>
<p>The complete list of store products can be found under Catalog &gt; Products. If this is your first time in the Products page, you will notice the default products pre-added by the installer. These products is useful for you to experiment and explore the available OpenCart features before launching your store. You will eventually need to delete these products to make room for your store&apos;s products.</p>
<p>Before products are added to the store, product categories should already be created. See <a href="en-gb/catalog/category/">Categories</a> before continuing with this section. With the product categories created, products are now ready to be added to the store.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> OpenCart allows products to be added one at a time, not bulk upload. Extensions can be purchased from the OpenCart marketplace to bulk upload multiple products at once.</div>
