<h1>Product Option Tab</h1>
<p>Options are extra selections that a customer can make on the product page before adding the product to the shopping cart. This could be a size or colour of the product. <a href="en-gb/catalog/option/">Options</a> are first created under Catalog &gt; Options before being assigned to the product.</p>
<p>Simply type the name of the option you wish to add to this product, and the autocomplete field will appear for you to make a selection. Once selected, the option will be displayed for you to add the option values. Only the select, radio and checkbox type options can have an option value added to it.</p>
