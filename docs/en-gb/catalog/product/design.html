<h1>Product Design Tab</h1>
<p>The design tab consists of the &quot;Layout Override&quot; feature. In this feature, you can choose to override a layout, such as using an &quot;Account&quot; page layout for this specific product instead of the default &quot;Product&quot; layout. For more information on layouts, see <a href="en-gb/extension/module/">Modules</a>. You can just leave it blank if you do not wish to override the layout.</p>
