<h1>Customers</h1>
<p>Shop owners should know who their customers are and how to manage their information. In the administration, customer information will need to be stored efficiently to remember any transactions made with their account. To access customer information, you can log into the administration panel of the OpenCart store. The Customer management sections are located under &quots;Customers&quot; in the main menu.</p>
<h2>Customers Listing Page</h2>
<p>When a customer creates an account or completes the checkout process (opting to sign up as your customer), OpenCart will store their information automatically. A complete list of customers will be displayed on this page. You can also add a new customer by clicking on the &quot;Add&quot; button at the top right of the page.</p>

<h2>Creating a Customer</h2>
<p>Customer accounts usually don&#39;t need to be created in the administration panel, since account information is stored automatically upon customer sign up at the store front. However, should you need to manually add customers, you can click on the &quot;Add&quot; button at the top right of the page. You will then be presented with a form with the following fields.</p>

<h3>History Tab</h3>
<p>The history tab allows you to add notes to a customer's account. This allows you to leave history for future references you need on the customer.</p>
<h3>Transactions Tab</h3>
<p>The transactions tab allows you to add or subtract store credits from the customer's account. The store credits can be used to offset an order during checkout. The transactions can be seen in the customer's account at the store front too.</p>
<h3>Reward Points</h3>
<p>The reward points tab allows you to add or subtract reward points from the customer's account. The reward points can be used to offset an order during checkout if a product is configured to support the reward points. Additionally, you will need to enable the reward points feature in OpenCart too.</p>
<h3>IP Addresses Tab</h3>
<p>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP Address</a> will reveal the location of customer&#39;s computer network. There are many website services available to shop owners, that will give the location for an IP address. The list of IP addresses the customer has used on your website is logged and displayed in this tab.</p>
