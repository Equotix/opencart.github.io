<h1>Customer Groups</h1>
<p>Customer Groups provide a greater organisational scheme for the customer list. This is helpful in selecting customer groups for discounted products and special offers in the store, and for sending out emails to specific groups of customers.</p>
<h2>Adding a Customer Group</h2>
<p>When creating a new customer group, you will be presented with the fields below.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Customer Group Name *</th>
    <td width="*">This is the name of the customer group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Description</th>
    <td>This is a description of the group for internal use.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Approve New Customers</th>
    <td>Setting this to &quot;Yes&quot; means that all customers will need to be manually approved by the admin before they can login if they selected this customer group during sign up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Sort Order</th>
    <td>This defines the arrangement of this customer group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" class="hints">* Required field</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
