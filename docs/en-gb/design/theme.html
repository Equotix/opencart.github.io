<h1>Theme Editor</h1>
<p>Theme editor is used to modify specific theme files. Prior coding knowledge on the template language Twig is required. By making the modification here, your changes will be reflected on your store front. This is equivalent to making a code change to your OpenCart theme design.</p>
<h2>Theme History</h2>
<p>The list of files modified will be stored and shown under the &quot;Theme History&quot; section. If you wish to revert any changes, you can simply delete the changes from the theme history section by clicking on the delete button.</p>
