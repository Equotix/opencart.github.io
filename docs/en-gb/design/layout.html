<h1>Layouts</h1>
<p>Layouts is used for attaching modules to the specific page you require. OpenCart comes pre-installed with a set of layouts. If you require more layouts, you can create them here as well, then attach it to specific products, categories, information pages or manufacturers. This will give you the ability to configure a different layout for the specific page you attach the layout to.</p>
<h2>Creating a Layout</h2>
<p>You can create a new layout simply by clicking on the &quot;add&quot; button at the top of the page. You will then be presented with a set of fields, which will be explained below.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Layout Name *</th>
    <td width="*">This is the name of the layout, which you can use to identify it in the design tab (available in products, categories, information pages and manufacturers) which gives you the ability to set the layout override.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Store</th>
    <td>This is for multi-store support. Select the store this layout should be used on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Route</th>
    <td>Enter the route this layout will be used on, or leave it empty if you intend to use it as a layout override The route can be identified by following the instructions below.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
