<h1>Banners</h1>
<p>Banners created are a collection of pictures containing linkable images displayed on the store&#39;s store front. Banners can be utilized to catch the customer&#39;s eye and direct them to special products or promotions in the store. The Banners here allows you customise the images and links displayed on the banners.</p>
<h2>Creating a Banner</h2>
<p>Certain modules, including third party modules, may use the banners created here. Simply create theme or modify them according to your needs.</p>
