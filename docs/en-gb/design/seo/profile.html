<h1>SEO Profiles</h1>
<p>SEO Profiles are used only when your SEO URL mode is enabled in System &gt; Settings. It is used to rewrite your website's URL to a search engine friendly format. The SEO Profiles created by OpenCart during installation is sufficient for most general purpose use, and third party plugins should add into it whenever necessary. If you need to append additional GET parameter keys for specific URLs, you can add or modify the SEO Profiles here.</p>
<h2>Creating a SEO Profile</h2>
<p>Elaborating on how the SEO Profile works, we will make use of the default installed &quot;Product&quot; profile. Below is an explanation of each field.</p>

<p class="text-center"><small>The form for adding a new SEO Profile.</small></p>
<p>Based on the above &quot;Product&quot; profile that comes with the default OpenCart installation, it can be understood that this profile is used to handle the SEO URL for the product page.</p>
<p>It first checks if the key &quot;product_id&quot; is available in the URL, and then uses regular expression to match for digits in the key value. Once it matches, it will push the route product/product back into the URL, and remove the route and product_id parameters. This allows the URL to be clean and link correctly to the SEO keyword you've set for the correct product.</p>
