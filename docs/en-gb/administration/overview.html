<h1>Admin Interface</h1>
<p>OpenCart&apos;s administration panel is where you can modify features, upload images, add products, keep track of customers, manage payments, and much more. Customisation in the admin affects how your customer will interact with your store. You can do so by modifying the look, structure, and content of the store front.</p>
<h2>Accessing the Admin Panel</h2>
<p>To access the admin panel, type in your store&apos; URL into the web browser followed by &quot;/admin&quot;. For example, if your store is located at &quot;www.chocolatechip.com&quot;, your admin panel is located at &quot;www.chocolatechip.com/admin&quot;. Even if the store is located in a sub-folder or on a sub-domain of their site, adding &quot;/admin&quot; to the end of the store&apos;s path will lead you to the administration panel.</p>
<p>If you&apos;ve changed the name of the folder after the installation, the location of the admin panel is changed to that new name. For example, if the name of the admin folder is changed to &quot;mysecretadmin&quot;, the new location of the admin panel is at &quot;www.chocolatchip.com/mysecretadmin&quot;.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><i class="fa  fa-check-circle"></i> Changing the name of the admin folder to another name is important to improve your online store&apos;s security. See <a href="en-gb/administration/security/">Basic Security Practices</a> for more information.</div>
<p>A username and password was created during <a href="en-gb/installation/">Step 3</a> of the installation. This information can now be used to fill in the administrator login details.</p>

<p>After filling in the correct username and password, pressing the &quot;Login&quot; button will direct you to your OpenCart dashboard. When you first login to your stop, the dashboard will be blank, because there isn&apos;t any statistical data to be shown yet.</p>

<h2>Dashboard Modules</h2>
<p>The dashboard is the first thing you will see when you login as an admin. The main function of the dashboard is to give the store owner an overview of how the store is performing. The dashboard modules can be rearranged and configured under the <a href="en-gb/extension/dashboard">Dashboard Extensions</a> as well. Below are the initial configured dashboard modules.</p>
