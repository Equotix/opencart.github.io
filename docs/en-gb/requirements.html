<h1>System / Server Requirements</h1>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>OpenCart has certain technical requirements to be met for the store to operate properly. A web server must be setup to make the OpenCart store publicly available on the web. Domain names and hosting services can easily be purchased at an affordable price.</p>
<p>For testing purposes, you can setup the store locally on your PC as well.</p>
<p>When choosing a web hosting provider, you should check to ensure that the server provided meets the requirements below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web Server (Apache / NGINX)</li>
  <li>PHP 7.3+</li>
  <li>Database (MySQLi / MariaDB)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Required PHP libraries / modules</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>cURL</li>
  <li>ZIP</li>
  <li>Zlib</li>
  <li>GD Library</li>
  <li>Mbstring</li>
  <li>Xml</li>
</ul>
<p>The above PHP extensions should be readily available on most servers by hosting providers. During the installation process, OpenCart will check whether you have them all enabled. You should contact your hosting provider if any is missing.</p>
