<h1>Orders</h1>
<p>When a customer goes through the checkout, the information on their order is automatically transferred to the Orders section for you to keep track of. In the administration, you can view all of the orders made on your website, manually add orders, or edit the details of existing orders.</p>
<h2>Viewing Orders</h2>
<p>The Orders section is located under Sales &gt; Orders. On this page, every order ever made from the store is listed in detail.</p>
<p>The following details are displayed for each order on the list.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Order ID</th>
    <td width="*">A number assigned to an order by OpenCart during the checkout confirmation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Store</th>
    <td>The store the order was made through. Typically your main store unless you have a multi-store setup.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Customer</th>
    <td>The name of the customer that made the order.</td>
  </tr>

<p>On the listing page, you can add, edit or delete an order. You can also search, print invoices or shipping list for the orders.</p>
<h2>Searching Orders</h2>
<p>The &quot;Filter&quot; panel on the right helps you find orders based on the information specified in the search fields. It can help you locate orders by date added or customer. The &quot;Filter&quot; cannot search for orders by product purchased yet. For more information on the <a href="en-gb/administration/filter/">Filter</a> tool, see Filter.</p>
<h2>Editing / Creating Order</h2>
<p>Customer orders will be automatically added to the order section after a customer confirms checkout. Though it is automatically updated, you may want to edit or add orders manually to add new information such as a gift voucher or reward points. To manually add a new order, click the &quot;Add&quot; button. To modify an existing order, click &quot;Edit&quot; under Action for the specific order.</p>
