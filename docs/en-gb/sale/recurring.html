<h1>Recurring Orders</h1>
<p>Recurring orders are payments that your customers are billed on a recurring basis, dependent on the recurring schedule you've setup.</p>
<p>You will first need to setup a <a href="en-gb/catalog/recurring-profile/">Recurring Profile</a>. Once setup and a customer makes an order with a recurring profile attached to it, the order information will show up on this page.</p>
<p>The Recurring Orders page will list the orders with the following information.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Recurring ID</th>
    <td width="*">A number OpenCart automatically generates.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Order ID</th>
    <td>The order ID this recurring order is associated to.</td>
  </tr>

It can help you locate recurring orders by date added, status, associate order ID or even the customer.
